Key functionalities include:

`equals()` Method: This method checks if the value of a specified environment variable (or variables) matches a provided value (or values). It supports both scalar and array inputs for variable names and values, and offers an optional strict mode for case-sensitive comparison.

`get()` Method: This method retrieves the value of a specified environment variable, with support for multiple possible names. It allows for default values if the environment variable is not found, and includes an optional strict mode for case-sensitive key matching.

The package's design ensures flexibility and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for managing environment variables in `PHP` applications.
